Chrome, Holmsie?
================

Holmsie is a simple HTML(5) problems detector for Google Chrome. It uses 
the [holmes][hs] CSS diagnostic stylesheet to highlight potentially invalid,
inaccessible or erroneous HTML(5) markup.

Check out the [holmes][hs] website for further information.

Installation
------------

Holmsie for Google Chrome is still in development. When I am confident that it
behaves reasonable, there would be a link to its Chrome add-on page.

Usage
-----

To enable the holmsie inspector in the context of the current page, click the
`Enable Holmsie Inspector` item on the mouse right-click context menu. If you
do not have such item in there, make sure that the page is still not loading.
The item will be available only when the page is ready.

Thanks
